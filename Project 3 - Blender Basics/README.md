# Project 3 - Blender Basics

This project focuses on learning the basics of Blender, including creating, modifying 3D scenes, and rendering. Below are the steps to complete the project:

1. **Examine Blender Files**: There is a folder named "blend_files" in the project folder. This folder contains .blend files completing different tasks. There are also two sub-folders named "part1" and "part2".

2. **Follow and Complete Tasks**: The "part1" folder contains completed versions of simple Blender tasks as given in the instructions. The "part2" folder contains completed versions of object and camera operations.

3. **Open Blender Files**: Open the relevant .blend files in Blender to examine and make modifications to the tasks.

4. **Experiment and Learn**: Take your time to experiment with Blender's tools and features. Feel free to explore additional resources such as [Blender's official documentation and tutorials](https://www.blender.org/).

5. **Render Your Scenes**: Once you've created your 3D scenes according to the instructions, render images of your scenes using Blender's rendering capabilities.
