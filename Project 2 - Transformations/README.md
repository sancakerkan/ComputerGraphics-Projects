# Project 2 - Transformations

This project implements transformations using JavaScript. It involves completing two JavaScript functions within the provided HTML file, which simulates a Drone.

## Project Overview

The `project2.html` file serves as the interface for the Drone simulation. It includes placeholders for the two JavaScript functions: `GetTransform` and `ApplyTransform`.

### GetTransform Function

The `GetTransform` function generates a 3x3 transformation matrix based on provided parameters: positionX, positionY, rotation, and scale.

### ApplyTransform Function

The `ApplyTransform` function combines two 3x3 transformation matrices to produce the resulting transformation.

## How to Use

1. Download the `project2.zip` file from LMS and extract it.
2. Open the `project2.html` file in a web browser.
3. Test the Drone simulation by interacting with it.

## Additional Information

- The project includes images such as `drone.png`, `propeller.png`, `shadow.png`, and `grass.jpeg`.
- Pressing the F4 key will reload the `project2.js` file without refreshing the entire page.
