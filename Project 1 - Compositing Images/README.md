# Project 1 - Compositing Images

This project implements an alpha compositing function for raster images using JavaScript. The provided HTML file contains a basic web-based image compositing tool, and the composite function is implemented in the `project1.js` file.

## Project Description

The `project1.html` file serves as the user interface for the image compositing tool. It allows users to load a background image and a foreground image, adjust the opacity of the foreground image, and position it on the background image.

The `project1.js` file contains the implementation of the composite function. This function blends the foreground image onto the background image using alpha blending, considering the provided opacity and position arguments.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Project 1 - Compositing Images` directory.
3. Open the `project1.html` file in a web browser.
4. Use the interface to load background and foreground images, adjust the opacity, and position the foreground image.
5. Test the composite function with different images and opacity values.

## Additional Information

- The composite function is implemented in the `project1.js` file.
- The project uses provided images (`background.png`, `cup.png`, and `tedu.png`) for testing, but you can use your own images as well.
- Pressing the F4 key will refresh the `project1.js` file without reloading the entire page, allowing you to quickly test your implementation.
